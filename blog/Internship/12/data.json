{"title":"Placement Fundae - Arnav Garg ","date":"20 September 2020","intro":"From \u201c1 Crore ka package\u201d in the first year to not even sitting for placements for higher studies, these 4 years teach you a lot more than any career counselor ever could. With the right goal in mind, persevering towards it is the key to achieve it. Let me introduce myself, my name is Arnav Garg, I\u2019m a Y16 undergraduate student majoring from the Civil Engineering department, and below is my journey from being a nervous, apprehensive freshman to securing a Day-1-Slot-1 job offer from JP Morgan & Chase as a Quantitative Researcher. ","content":"<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">My field of interest lies in Quantitative analysis and algorithms. For those of you who don\u2019t know, Quant is basically a mixture of Mathematics and Finance used to solve financial problems. It extensively relies on your analytical skills along with the knowledge of Probability theory. This knowledge is used to build mathematical models for various predictive purposes, the work which I hope to pursue in the future.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Often one hears seniors talk about the importance of POR in placements and yet the POR section in my resume didn\u2019t have any major highlights; \u201cAcademic mentor, CS'', \u201cStudent Guide, CS'' and \u201cSecretary, Robotics club\u201d. And while they may have an impact, I believe there is no direct relationship. I\u2019d say I had a decent CPI (8.4 at the time of placements). It was towards the end of the second year when I started to worry about the upcoming months; no hard skills, no technical interests, adequate CPI, and definitely, no PORs. Some very wise words from my seniors and my initial fascination with algorithms found me going for the most unconventional skill which very few people in the campus work on :coding. I\u2019ll be talking more about how I went about preparing in the latter part of the blog.<\/span><\/p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/nLj7eh8tF7_WrKP7HqT2SvJRX2kxbL4bdZRbme2V4qIekTfyDjo12dTQt4TSYlf7yACuNKKRlfNXHREBnS8wWUoX3Rmrem2CQEQUwqi6OjdLVqteZNT38T1hwkuhNZ066dTQ52Y\"><\/figure><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">I had about a couple of projects in ML which, believe me, were not a big deal. One of them was under P lub, which was more like an online course I did along with my peers. The other was a project I did in my second year summers, under Prof. Nitin Gupta (BSBE dept.). I was part of a team that coded chatbots to diagnose mentally ill patients. For people who want to do projects in ML, Coursera\/Udacity is the best source. Getting a project under a prof. is tough, given that not many profs. in our college actively work in ML. You need to prove yourself before you\u2019re offered a summer opportunity. I started mailing profs as soon as the 2nd year winters and worked with them throughout the 4th sem before I was finally accepted for the summers.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">I secured an internship with Fidelity Investments as an Analyst through SPO .The good part of an internship is that it gives you a glimpse of the life you\u2019re going to live ahead; you get a stipend, you spend it, and earn your living. Going house hunting with your friends, cooking your meals at night, the weekend parties, and spending hours on the office foosball table, all of it was so surreal as if it happened just recently. I still remember the moment when I went to encash my first stipend cheque, it was so liberating! Too bad COVID robbed people of this experience.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Throughout the years, I never got enough interested enough in my branch. Not being associated with core branch work at any point, the huge dearth of opportunities in the core sector, a natural fascination towards coding\/algorithms, and a huge affinity for the work I did in my intern were some of the factors which led me to sit for the Quant\/Coding profile in the placements.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">While people spend the intern months in pure ecstasy and delight, there is always a bug gnawing them in hindsight, and that is the fear and reluctance of the next sem; the Placement sem. While toiling hard in internships to receive a PPO is good, I've seen many people accepting PPO\u2019s just to avoid the hassle and the fear of rejection of the placements. DO NOT SETTLE FOR LESS! Choosing a job that you are not interested in is analogous to choosing a non-preferred branch in an Old IIT; You\u2019ll like the stately workplace(campus) but not the work(courses), and you\u2019ll end up seeking a job change(branch change).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">The process of Placements is largely fair and vindicated, unlike the \u2018throw of a dice\u2019 intern season. The basic timeline is similar to that of the internship, though.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">As soon as I came back from my internship, I started working on my resume. The SPO needs your resume by around mid-August, which might extend till the end of August after a few deadline extensions. Having seen various resumes of my fellow peers, I have observed one thing, people of our college just don\u2019t care enough about their resumes! No matter how many <\/span>resume<span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\"> preparing workshops are held, no matter how many seniors review them, it\u2019s never up to the mark. I remember a friend who had a typo in his own name in his resume, and he noticed that during the 6th sem when half the intern season was already over!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Though it\u2019s already been said quite a few times, please use Latex only to prepare your resume. Get it reviewed by relevant seniors, go through multiple iterations to arrive at the final draft. I prepared 3 resumes; one for finance, one for fintech, and the third for pure coding.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Starting preparation is the toughest task, I procrastinated until late August when it began to get scary. Too traumatized by the intern selection experience where I was rejected many times due to my branch, I knew the placement scenario was not going to be different, so I hoped for the PPO. The results came at the end of August, and I wasn\u2019t offered one. That was when I realized I was in deep trouble, cause I had not even begun my preparation!<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">I started by preparing my schedule, I shortlisted all the important topics relevant for placements; from BST, Hashing, DP, Graph, linked list to Probability, Hypothesis, expectation value, etc. The list was so long, I was already feeling cramped. I associated each topic with a date and pledged to stick to the schedule. All in all, I \u2018planned\u2019 to complete it by the end of October.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/AUJ9yIgIyziFGEr-5In2_Q72eE3KPAD45QNjCgTITLnbRcICqceZu3GUdwM3DkrjCRVYv5VkOupXpSQZHRlCkjSSN0OpFYoH4qrqpMaxDKrDgkuAJxqucdFQTvbHFmmp8DFZEYo\"><\/figure><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">I started with Quant as it is usually overlooked but is of paramount importance. The reason I say that is, you see you\u2019ll find many students enhancing their coding skills for clearing the tests, but what happens is that at the end companies will prefer CS students over you for core coding profiles no matter what. But if you know Quant, you would have an edge over all the other non-core profiles, because competition for Quant is less, as few people work on this skill making it all the more important. I religiously did the book \u2018Fifty Challenging problems\u2019 and practiced questions from brainstellar.com, which was sufficient to have a good grasp over Quant.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">I had been coding since the second year, which kind of gives you a small ego boost over people who had just started coding for placement purposes in the last year. This happened to me, too confident in the coding skills I didn\u2019t practice at all. And boy oh boy I managed to solve just 1 question out of 3 in my first coding test, while my peers, who had just started coding managed to solve 2, some even the 3rd (partially)! That was my wake up call to start practicing. I started with interviewbit.com, which is an excellent source for placement prep. It has questions with company tags which helps you in solving questions specific to the company you are targeting. Moreover, it provides a very elegant solution approach; it gives you a hint, then the solution approach, and finally, the complete solution. I found it to be very helpful. This combined with geeksforgeeks.com was enough for me to ace my tests.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Once the tests commence there is no going back. There are days when you give 4-5 tests in a day along with ppts and regular classes. And if the tests don\u2019t go well, you feel more crappy. I used to doze off as soon as I hit the bed. For about a month, my schedule was like this: attend classes till afternoon, attend ppts till evening, give tests till about 1 AM, eat in the canteen, sleep and repeat. The remaining time was spent in discussing \u201cye vala kaise kiya\u201d, \u201cye to aise karna tha na\u201d. Being from civil, there were not many companies open for us initially. So we used to wait in our wings while the CS\/EE\/MTH peeps returned, to ask them \u201cKya puccha?\u201d It made me envious of them initially, but later on, I realized it\u2019s a good thing. Unnecessarily applying for all the companies to be on \u2018the safe side\u2019, attending ppts, giving tests, it takes up a lot of your time. A better strategy is to stick true to your profile and only apply and prepare for those roles. Moreover, SPO has now limited the maximum applications to 50, which is more than enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">One of the most important aspects of the 7th sem is balancing your academics with the preparation. Most people have a tailor-made excuse to avoid acads, \u201c7th sem ki CPI thodi count hogi towards placement\u201d and leave their acads on god\u2019s will. I didn\u2019t entirely go with that attitude. One of the very few good things that are there about my dept, is that the 7th sem is very light. To top it, I had done a course in one of the summers previously which left me with about just 45 credits to take care of. This eased the burden to some extent. Also, with that there goes some careful planning, knowing that the second half of the sem would be riddled with tests, it\u2019s a good thing to score well in your midterms to have some backup. Try to not leave it on the End Sems, as much as possible. Use the experience you\u2019ve gained in the previous 6 sems to pass the course smartly.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Usually, when the Endsems get over, people heave a sigh of relief, only it\u2019s the opposite in placements. The placement anxiousness combined with the November chills is not a very good feeling. My Endsems got over on the 20th, so I reserved the last 10 days for the trivial stuff; going through my resume again, preparing answers to popular HR questions, preparing my introduction, stuff which people usually miss out and which often differentiates you and the selected candidate. A senior once advised me \u201cResume ke har point ke peeche ek puri kahani honi chahiye\u201d, and now that I am in those shoes, I can\u2019t agree more.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">I made it to 5 interview shortlists on Day-1; 3 in slot-1 and 2 in slot-2. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan &amp; Chase, and Blackrock were the slot-1 firms, I don\u2019t remember&nbsp; the slot-2 ones. Now, slot-1 runs from 5 AM to 1 PM, and mind you this is December, enough to give you the chills. All of the activities take place in Hall-13. I got a call from an SPO volunteer at around 4 in the morning that my interview with GS was scheduled at 5:15 AM, so I should be there on time. I washed my face, put on my suit, had my breakfast (mess was kept open exclusively for this), and cycled my way in the dark to Hall-13. I waited for my turn; 5:15 turned to 6:15, to 7:15, and finally to 9:15, no interview. Finally, at 9:30 I was called for my first round. The interviewer was a mechanical graduate from IITB, I thought he might go easy on me (poor me). I answered 2\/3 questions correctly but was never called for the next round. Since JPMC also hadn\u2019t called me for the first round and it was already 10 AM, I thought my day was over (I politely declined Blackrock for the interview as they were interviewing me for their core finance profile, which I wasn\u2019t aiming for). Just as I was about to leave, I got a call from JPMC at 10:30 for my first round.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">First Round<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">I started by introducing myself, speaking about my areas of technical expertise, and the fields I\u2019ve worked in. The interviewer asked me some algo questions and some quant questions which I was able to answer, though not fully. In situations such as these when you don\u2019t know the complete answer, it\u2019s very important to convey your approach, often the final answer is not what they are looking for. After that, she asked me about object-oriented programming, polymorphism, the core CS stuff. The fact that I had zero knowledge about this combined with the frustration of the past 6 hours led me to say an abrupt \u2018No\u2019. I didn\u2019t even try to make something, blankly said I don\u2019t know about it. Maybe honesty was what got me to the next round, because it wasn\u2019t the answers.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Second Round<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">This was the round that tilted the entire selection in my favour. The interviewer started by asking simple expectation value puzzles, which I was able to answer. About 10 mins in, we had an argument over a question, as his answer didn\u2019t match mine, but I was pretty sure mine was correct. While casually glancing over my resume, his eyes fell on one particular course, ESO-208 (Numerical Methods). I don\u2019t know what came upon him, but he immediately started discussing it. Now that is a compulsory course in my dept. in the 5th sem, but I took up that course in my 7th sem, so all the course content was completely afresh in my mind. What followed then was a very bright conversation; I answered almost all of his questions and left him satisfied and smiling (Michael Scott gang rise up). The courses which I berated, the dept. which I loathed ultimately helped me in my selection!. After the interview, he told me that I was even right about the question we argued about.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Third Round<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">From this round onwards I went all guns blazing. The interview started with the ML projects I had mentioned in my resume, which I explained confidently. This was followed by a string of about 15 quant questions, of which I was able to answer at least 13. I could feel preparation making the difference, my approach, my thinking got so much structured from the intense past months that I sailed through the question with ease.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Fourth Round<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">This was one of the most baffling rounds. After the confidence high of the previous rounds, I was ready for this one too. But the interviewer asked me something which I completely forgot to revise in my preparation schedule: Probability distributions; stuff related to HSO-201 (which I did in my second year). Over 20 minutes, I answered just 1 question, and that too with the help of the interviewer. I felt devastated over the lost opportunity, which the interviewer saw through me. I was sure that this was going to be the shortest round, just then the interviewer took one final glance over me and started explaining the role. It went on for about 20 mins after which I was let go.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Fifth Round(HR)<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">This was the easiest round. Where do you belong to, what do your parents do, what do you think about Bombay, and similar questions. I was relieved to have a light round after the usual intense ones. You need to be fluent in English to pass through this.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">At about 1 PM we all gathered around the pinboard on the ground floor. It was a huge chaos, so many nervous students pushing each other, some heaving a sigh of relief and some with tears in their eyes. When I finally got to the front, I saw the bulleted list. There it was, my name, in the 5th position. I clicked a pic of the list, shared it in the wing group, and called my parents. That walk, from Hall-13 to Hall-1, talking with my parents, with welled up eyes, is the one I\u2019ll remember forever. \u201cEk hi jhatke mein merse zada kamane lage\u201d, dad remarked.<\/span><\/p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/kHAhrhN71_vHrh63SFea3x-oLMwz-ubmk5rNT-poSUvbGbdYp7E5OLcc9V70Mp6xJvTQXKufutFdog744C-Y-NqqquoeErjGQnXlgcsiyKomfUluSgD2nqd-hvIwWOarcZqJZwU\"><\/figure><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Sitting in placements was one of the most beautiful experiences of my stay here because it reinstated the fact that your outcomes, your results are a function of your efforts. Being from a non-circuital branch I faced a lot of \u2018branch racism\u2019 during interns, but believe me, companies in placements will only judge you based on your test scores\/skills, so prepare immaculately. If some of your tests go below par don\u2019t panic, take it as an opportunity to improve because you\u2019ll be giving many more. Don\u2019t worry if you have zero interns on your resume or a low CPI, JUST ACE THE TEST, and every sin would be forgotten. Companies hardly care about that if you have a good skill-set\/test-score to compensate for (I was not asked a single question from my intern project, anywhere). Lastly don\u2019t blindly go for lucrative packages and compromise on your interests, the CTC is often not the real picture. I know it would be a tiring, frustrating sem, but the result is so great that it\u2019s worth it. So just hang in there, as Bryan Cranston would\u2019ve said, \u201ctake a chance, take a risk, find that passion, rekindle it, fall in love all over again, it\u2019s really worth it!\u201d<\/span><\/p>","author":"Arnav Garg"}
