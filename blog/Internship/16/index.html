                Hello all the readers!!!
                So here I am describing my journey of getting an internship at AB InBev, how I prepared for it, and the
                entire process of selection.
                Starting with a little introduction about myself – I am kind of a person who is not much involved in
                campus activities and clubs. Though being in the Department of Materials Science which is not too
                hectic, I did not participate in much of the things. I had been a part of the athletics team of the
                institute for some time and was a Student Guide (which proved to be one of the best experiences for me).





                <br>
              </p>
              <img src="./rcover.png" class="blog-cover" />
              <p>
                <br />
                So this was a bit of a background about me.
                Now, some information about the company. So, AB InBev came for two profiles - one is technology intern
                in which I was selected and the other Data science. It was open to all branches, and eligibility for the
                test was CPI>=7.5. The one-hour test was the same for both the profiles and had three sections – <br />
                1) Aptitude MCQs<br />
                2) OOPs MCQs<br />
                3) Two coding questions<br />
                <br /><br />
                Then there was a group interview which was basically a group discussion, but everyone was given a chance
                to speak. And the last step was the interview.
                <br /><br />
                Next, speaking about my preparation. Frankly speaking, my preparation was not too good, so to say. I
                started practicing coding a bit and some aptitude questions. In particular I did not prepare for any
                specific profile or company, just did the usual stuff of coding and aptitude and almost filled for all
                the companies which were open for MSE. Since I wasn’t very familiar with cpp and not good at coding, it
                took time for me to solve questions due to which I often got frustrated.
                <br /><br />
                Nevertheless, though slow, I continued with the coding practice. Some of the resources which I used were
                Prepleaf for aptitude and Leetcode and Interview bit for coding. When the tests began, I did not perform
                very well in many tests. This was very depressing, and I was distraught. But then, there was this test
                in which I did well and ultimately secured the internship.
                <br /><br />
                Coming to the procedure post test. Firstly, the Group discussion was based on normal topics and no
                technical topics were given. It was easier than normal GDs as people were given a chance to speak, and
                there was nothing like starting the GD and concluding it. Each one had to make his/her point on the
                topic, and marks were given based on the relevance of the point to the topic. Those selected in GD were
                then called for interviews. The interview was resume based, and they asked some questions from projects
                mentioned in the resume. There were also HR questions in the same interview. One thing that is important
                for HR questions is how creative your answers are. Basically, they were very interested to know how
                enthusiastic you are about doing anything.
                <br /><br />
                In the end all I would like to say is that just don’t get demotivated at any point of time. Give your
                best, and if things are not going your way, don’t get disheartened. There will be many times where you
                might feel that you deserved it more than someone who actually got it and he/she was just fortunate
                enough to get it. And yes, its true!! Besides preparation, there is a role that luck plays undoubtedly,
                but just remember hardwork will always hold your hand no matter what, whether luck is there with you or
                not. A wonderful answer to a question – if fortune plays a role then why should we work ? was given to
                me by someone- You can be lucky or unlucky once, twice, thrice but not every time. So, even if you
                spoiled some tests and were not selected, this would not continue all the time, and your preparation
                will turn out successful for sure. If you are not seeing things getting your way now, they will after
                some time, just give your best.
                <br /><br />
                All The Very Best To All !!
              </p>
